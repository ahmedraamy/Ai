# Emotion detection app using ML

This project was part of amit ai 1 week scholarship.

The dataset was taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013.

This model achieved maximum test accuracy of 60% of 5 classes('Angry', 'Disgust', 'Fear', 'Happy', 'Neutral', 'Sad', 'Surprise').
- It missclassifies in classes ('Disgust', 'Fear','Surprise') the most, due to 	unbalanced dataset and low number of samples.
